Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and content of the web page.

"What we do" Section: Details the company's offerings and mission.

Results Section: Showcases key achievements and statistics.

Contact Section: A form for users to get in touch.

Footer: A clean and professional footer with social media links.

Interactions and Styling
The design adheres to the following interaction and styling rules:

Maximum Content Width: The main content of the page is centered with a maximum width of 1000px.

Links (<a>): When a link is hovered over or is active, its color changes to #FF6565.

Buttons (<button>): When a button is hovered over or is active, its opacity changes to 0.9 for a subtle visual feedback.
